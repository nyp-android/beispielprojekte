# Data Binding
The Data Binding Library is a support library that allows you to bind UI components in your layouts to data sources in your app using a declarative format rather than programmatically.

## Aim of This Project
As developers, the first thing you should know about the practical usage of data binding is either in a signup activity or login activity. This project teaches you a very clear, concise and easy way of implementing data binding in a simple login application without bringing the extra fluff of MVP pattern or MVVM pattern that some developers battle with.
